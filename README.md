# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.


After that, run the following command in the terminal:
npm i
to install all dependencies, router, and other necessary components required for the app to work as I have designed it.


The objective of this project is to create a web application using React.js that interacts with the PokeAPI (https://pokeapi.co/). The application will consist of two pages: the Landing Page, which displays a grid of Pokémon cards, and the Pokemon Details Page, which shows detailed information about a specific Pokémon. The project will display the first 864 Pokémon characters across 36 pages, with 24 Pokémon cards on each page. The pagination will display 5 buttons, with the active button centered except on the first and last pages. Additionally, the project should include features such as search functionality, the ability to mark favorite Pokémon, and persistent data storage using Local Storage.

Features:

Search Functionality:

I have implemented a search bar that allows users to search for Pokémon by name.
It includes three search options: A-Z, Z-A, and the default preset.
A-Z: Sorts Pokémon by name in ascending order.
Z-A: Sorts Pokémon by name in descending order.
Default: Resets the search to the default order.
Favorite Pokémon:

Allows users to mark their favorite Pokémon by clicking a like button.
Pokémon Info Page:

Displays detailed information about a specific Pokémon.
Information includes the Pokémon's name, abilities, types, and any other relevant details.
I have implemented persistent data storage using Local Storage to store the user's favorite Pokémon. The favorite Pokémon will persist even after the user refreshes the page.

Technologies:

React.js: Use React.js as the primary JavaScript framework for building the application.
Axios / Fetch: Utilize Axios or fetch for making HTTP requests to the PokeAPI.
React Router: Use React Router for handling routing between pages.
Local Storage: Implement Local Storage to store and retrieve the user's favorite Pokémon.
Styling Framework: Bootstrap, for enhanced styling and layout consistency.


Additional:

In this project, there is an About page that describes the project.

I have added additional features like:

Favicon image to be displayed in the tab.
Imported Google Fonts.
Scroll button to navigate the page.
Added logo image inside the header.
Added a footer with my name and the current date, which is automatically displayed.
        
The project is hosted on GitHub, where you can access the entire codebase. You can visit the GitHub repository to view the code and explore the project in detail.

Additionally, the project is also deployed on the Vercel platform, allowing you to see how it looks and functions in a live environment. You can visit the Vercel deployment to interact with the web application and experience its features firsthand.
